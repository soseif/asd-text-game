            text: "For ASD individuals without intellectual disabilities (who often possess normal cognition or even high intelligence, especially chronically undiagnosed women), suicide driven by severe depression is the leading cause of premature death. Research indicates that the risk of death by suicide for this group is 7 to 9 times higher than that of the general population (Cassidy et al., 2014; 2024)."

Research shows autistic women are up to 13 times more likely to die by suicide compared to women in the general population, a stark contrast to the 6-fold increased risk seen in autistic men (Hirvikoski et al., 2016)."

            text: "Current diagnostic criteria are built almost exclusively on male subjects, leaving the male-to-female diagnosis ratio chronically sitting between 3:1 and 4:1. Many autistic women fly 'under the radar' because they do not exhibit standard male-centric phenotypes (e.g., callousness, lack of empathy, or obsession with mechanics)."

            text: "Very few women fit the 'eccentric genius' stereotype. Instead, to survive, they expend an immense amount of cognitive energy to 'mask' as neurotypical. This chronic masking leads to severe 'Autistic Burnout.' When their energy levels are depleted or they enter social situations they have not mastered, causing the 'mask' to accidentally slip, they are placed in immense psychological danger."

        intro: "When we look at the workplace, the data is equally shocking. According to the National Autism Indicators Report by the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute, the unemployment or underemployment rate for autistic college graduates and adults is a staggering 85%. This stands in stark, brutal contrast to the US national average unemployment rate of only about 3.5% to 4%. What holds them back is seldom their technical competence, but rather systemic stigma.",

Although advocacy cases specifically concerning autism and neurodiversity have surged by 650% in recent years, this is merely an underestimate and the tip of the iceberg.",

              "Lack of Awareness and Fear: Data from the Return on Disability Group indicates that less than 20% of neurodivergent employees request workplace accommodations. Most autistic women consider it a 'hidden disability,' terrified that if they disclose, they will face retaliation or jeopardize their careers.",
              "The Binary Trap of Accommodations: Even when accommodations are given, they are mostly superficial. However, due to the literal thinking of ASD individuals, this is considered 'accommodated' as a binary outcome. As long as the company has taken an action, they silently endure high-pressure environments that haven't substantially improved."

            points: [
              "Targeted Without Realizing It: When placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), they rarely question the outcome. To their logic, being held accountable for things they cannot fully control doesn't come off as odd because 'the truth that it happened is more true than recognizing they are being treated differently.' They struggle to perceive the hidden double standards where others are not held accountable for the same mistakes.",
              "The Silent Meltdown: Unlike in clinical tests where triggers are clear, in the complex reality of a workplace, most autistic individuals are not actively or immediately aware of when and how their sensory overload is triggered. As a result, their meltdowns often happen silently and without any apparent warning. Many do not even realize they are desperately struggling on the very edge of severe burnout until they completely collapse.",
              "The Backlash of Stereotypes: Once they disclose, they are rarely seen as geniuses. Instead, they are read with the stereotype on the other extreme: volatile, unable to control their feelings, and facing 'Rain Man' assumptions. This invites bullying and eventually forces an exodus."
